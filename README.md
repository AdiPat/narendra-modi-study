## Motivation

As a person, Narendra Modi has deeply inspired me to develop a stronger work ethic, the will to contribute to the Bharat (India), and build a strong action-oriented approach to life. 

With this study, my goal was to research facts about our beloved Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi and compile the insights in a neat, professional report that can be used by my students and connections to learn, improve and draw inspiration from.

I've always believed in the power of studying legends and integrating their learnings to my life. Since 2015, Narendra Modi's journey has not only inspired me to do something positive for India, but has also helped me develop an integral passion for the Yogic Science. 

As you already know, Modiji is an ardent Yoga practitioner and credits the Yogic Sciences for a large part of his success. So one aspect of this study was to highlight the interconnections between Modiji's Yoga Practice and overall success so that more people, globally, feel encouraged to explore the benefits of Yogic Practises.

Lastly, given that we're in the age of AI, one of my objectives has been "how can we leverage AI to help the government better serve the people of our country?" â€” this study is a small step in that direction. Hopefully, with the technology used in this study, more people will adapt it to be better citizens, become AI-enabled, and use AI & software for government initiatives that can potentially enhance the lives of people!
